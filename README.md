Gogs - Go Git Service
=====================

Gogs(Go Git Service) is a GitHub-like clone in the Go Programming Language.

## Purpose

There are some very good products in this category such as [gitlab](http://gitlab.com), but the environment setup steps often make us crazy. So our goal of Gogs is to build a GitHub-like clone with very easy setup steps, which take advantages of the Go Programming Language.
