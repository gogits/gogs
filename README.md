=====================

Gogs(Go Git Service) is a GitHub-like clone in the Go Programming Language, it currently supports Linux and Max OS X, but Windows has **NOT** supported yet due to installation problem with [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/) in Windows.

##### Current version: 0.0.7 Alpha

## Purpose

There are some very good products in this category such as [gitlab](http://gitlab.com), but the environment setup steps often make us crazy. So our goal of Gogs is to build a GitHub-like clone with very easy setup steps, which take advantages of the Go Programming Language.
