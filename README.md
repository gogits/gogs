Gogs - Go Git Service [![Go Walker](http://gowalker.org/api/v1/badge)](https://gowalker.org/github.com/gogits/gogs)
=====================

Gogs(Go Git Service) is a GitHub-like clone in the Go Programming Language.

## Purpose

There are some very good products in this category such as [gitlab](http://gitlab.com), but the environment setup steps often make us crazy. So our goal of Gogs is to build a GitHub-like clone with very easy setup steps, which take advantages of the Go Programming Language.

## Overview

Please see [Wiki](https://github.com/gogits/gogs/wiki) for project design.

## Installation

### Dependencies

- [Go Programming Language](http://golang.org): Main develop language.
